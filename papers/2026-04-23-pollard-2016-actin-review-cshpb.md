## What they found

Comprehensive authoritative review of actin biochemistry and all major actin-binding protein
families. Covers sequestering proteins (profilin, thymosin-β4), nucleators (Arp2/3, formins,
WH2-domain proteins), elongators, cappers, severers, and cross-linkers. Full-text open access
on PMC.

## Numbers that matter

**Profilin × G-actin:**
- Kd = 0.1 μM for ATP-actin — sets benchmark for high-affinity sequestration

**Thymosin-β4 × G-actin:**
- Micromolar affinity (Kd ~1 μM); cellular concentration > 100 μM → sequesters large monomer pool

**Actin-binding domains (ABDs, calponin-homology type) × F-actin:**
- "ABDs typically have relatively low affinity for actin filaments (Kd ~10 μM)"
- This is the Pollard consensus for ABD-class F-actin binders
- WH2 is NOT an ABD (different fold, different binding site) but the comparison is instructive:
  even canonical F-actin cross-linkers have Kd ~10 μM

**WH2 × actin (from this review):**
- WH2 binds in the barbed-end groove (actin subdomains 1/3 cleft)
- Functions: deliver actin to barbed end, template nucleation via tandem repeats
- No Kd measurements given for WH2 directly; references Chereau 2005

**Barbed end kinetics (ATP-actin):**
- k_on ≈ 10 μM⁻¹s⁻¹, k_off ≈ 1 s⁻¹, critical concentration ≈ 0.1 μM

**Total cellular actin:**
- 50–200 μM in eukaryotic cells
- ~half unpolymerized at any moment (maintained by profilin + thymosin-β4 pool)

**Critical concentration for ADP-actin = 1.8 μM** (Pollard 1986; consistent)

## Relevance to hydrogel model

The "Kd ~10 μM for ABD-class cross-linkers" is the best available proxy for WH2 × F-actin
side-binding in the absence of direct measurement. The model's WH2_KD_FACTIN_M = 5 μM is
therefore in the right ballpark as an optimistic estimate but has no primary measurement
backing. A more conservative estimate would be 10–100 μM or higher.

  for ABD-class F-actin binders is best proxy for WH2_KD_FACTIN_M

  competition, physiological actin monomer concentrations

  same kinetics plus broader context
